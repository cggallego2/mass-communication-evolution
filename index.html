            <h2>Development of Symbols</h2>
            <em>30000 BCE</em>
            <p>The imperfection of language allowed ideas to spread more easily, eventually leading to the development of new forms of communication that improved both the range with which people could communicate and the longevity of information. All of these inventions were based on the fundamental concept of the symbol.</p>
            <p>Gestures, signs, objects, signals, and words are examples of symbols that help people understand the world around them. They provide clues to understanding experiences by conveying recognizable meanings that are shared by societies.</p>
            <p>Individuals who are unable or have difficulty communicating using speech alone frequently use symbol-based communication. Symbols provide a visual representation of a word or idea.</p>
            <p>The discovery of such alleviated the limitations of pure oral communication. People now have the ability to share ideas that cannot be described by voice. For example, if one discovers a strange animal that no one else has seen, using symbols to describe it will undoubtedly be useful.</p>

            <p>This system delivered messages over long distances much faster than postmen and, once built, had lower long-term operating costs. It is a series of stations, usually towers, whose purpose is to transmit textual information via visual cues. The first successful optical telegraph was built in 1792 by French engineer Claude Chappe and his brothers, who covered France with a network of 556 stations spanning 4,800 kilometers. Until the 1850s, the Chappe system was used for military and national communications.</p>

            <em>1896</em>
            <p>Radio waves were first identified and studied by German physicist Heinrich Hertz in 1886. The first practical radio transmitters and receivers were developed around 1895â€“1896 by Italian Guglielmo Marconi, and radio began to be used commercially around 1900.</p>
            <p>Paper has long served as a medium of mass communication, appearing in newspapers, magazines, and books. However, paper cannot travel for an extended period of time before reaching a wider audience and revealing what is contained within it. As technology advances, a device that captures signals can aid in the dissemination of information. These inventions are the telegraph and radio, which provide the opportunity to make new discoveries and for the audience to become more aware in some ways due to the arrival of radios.</p>
            <p>As technology advances, so does the rate at which information travels. And one thing is certain: whenever there is a new discovery, there is an opportunity to invent or create something based on it.</p>

            <em>2070</em>
            <p>Fifty years from now, we believe that communication will be primarily accomplished through advanced gadgets that are integrated into our daily lives. Examples are eyeglasses, watches, and clothing. We believe that smartphones will be non-existent and will evolve into smaller, better, and more convenient gadgets in the future.</p>
            <p>We believe that communication will be extended beyond humans. Artificial intelligence has sparked a great deal of interest in recent years. We also think we will be able to develop self-aware robots capable of interacting with humans. They will be able to not only think and communicate, but also to assist us in our daily lives.</p>
            <p>In terms of media, as more people gain access to the internet, information sharing will become instantaneous. To add to the preceding idea, we believe that accessing them will be done through advanced gadgets as well.</p>
