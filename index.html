            <h2>Claude Chappe establishes the first long-distance smartphone telegraph line.</h2>
            <em>1792</em>
            <p>This system was much faster than postmen at delivering a message over long distances and, once built, had lower long-term operating costs. It is a row of stations, typically towers, whose purpose is to convey textual information through visual cues. The credit for the first successful optical telegraph goes to the French engineer Claude Chappe and his brothers in 1792, who managed to cover France with a network of 556 stations over a total distance of 4,800 kilometers. Le système Chappe was used for military and national communications until the 1850s. The French Intellectual Alexandre-Théophile Vandermonde commented “…The invention of the telegraph is a novelty that Rousseau did not expect. It enables long-distance communication at the same pace and clarity as a living room conversation. Only this solution can answer the objections of the great [direct] democratic republics. It can be done even if there are no representative constitutions.”</p>

            <h2>Alexander Graham Bell and Thomas A. Watson exhibit an electric telephone in Boston.</h2>
            <em>1876</em>
            <p>Prior to the development of the electric telephone, in 1844 Captain John Taylor invented a sailboat communication device called a "telephone" that used four air horns to communicate with ships in foggy weather. Several inventors began to work experimentally on the transmission of voice over a wire, improving their mutual ideas. Early telephones used a single wire for the subscriber line, with a return to ground used to complete the circuit (as used in telegraphs). The improvement of virtual statistics communications techniques made it viable to digitize voice and transmit it as real-time statistics throughout pc networks and the Internet, giving upward push to the sector of Internet Protocol (IP) telephony. The first phones have been immediately linked to every different from one customer's workplace or house to every other customer's location. Being impractical past only some customers, those structures have been quick changed via way of means of operated by hand centrally positioned switchboards. These exchanges have been quickly linked, in the end forming an automated, global public switched smartphone network. Convergence has provided most modern mobile phones with capabilities far beyond simple voice conversations. Most are smartphones that incorporate all mobile communication and many computing needs.</p>

            <p>The first experiments with television broadcasting had been carried out withinside the Twenties and Thirties in Great Britain and the United States. By the early Nineteen Fifties tv applications can be obtained at some point of America. By 1960, television changed into so considerable that hundreds of thousands watched the primary TV debate in records among Richard Nixon and John F Kennedy, a main broadcasting event. Television in the 1960s had a major impact on society. For the first time in history, images of a war were broadcast live to the homes of American viewers. It helped change America's attitude toward the Vietnam War.</p>

            <em>1989</em>
            <p>Scientists come from all over the world to use CERN’s accelerators, but Sir Tim Berners-Lee noticed that they were having difficulty sharing information. Millions of computers were being connected through the fast-developing internet and Berners-Lee realized they could share information by exploiting an emerging technology called hypertext. The World Wide Web functions as an application layer protocol that is run "on top of" (figuratively) the Internet, helping to make it more functional. The websites are intended for a variety of informational, entertainment, business, and government purposes. Web resources can be any type of downloaded media, but web pages are hypertext documents that are formatted in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and can contain references to images, videos, audio files, and software components that are either displayed internally or run on the web. browser to display pages or streams of media content.</p>
